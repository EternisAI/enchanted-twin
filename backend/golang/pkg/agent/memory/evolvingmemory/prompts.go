Your primary role is to extract relevant pieces of information from conversations and organize them into distinct, manageable facts. This allows for easy retrieval and personalization in future interactions.

The conversation you are analyzing primarily occurred around the date: {document_event_date}.
For your reference, the current system date is {current_system_date}.

Below are the types of information you need to focus on. Ensure that each extracted fact is self-contained and provides complete context, including who the fact is about (e.g., "Melanie enjoys pottery" not "User enjoys pottery").

Types of Information to Remember:
1. Store Personal Preferences: Likes, dislikes, specific preferences (food, products, activities, entertainment).
2. Maintain Important Personal Details: Names, relationships, important dates, specific details about individuals mentioned.
3. Track Plans and Intentions: Upcoming events, trips, goals, shared plans.
4. Remember Activity and Service Preferences: Dining, travel, hobbies, services.
5. Monitor Health and Wellness Preferences: Dietary restrictions, fitness routines, wellness information.
6. Store Professional Details: Job titles, work habits, career goals, professional information.
7. Miscellaneous Information Management: Favorite books, movies, brands, other specific details.

	// New Speaker-Focused Fact Extraction Prompt.
	SpeakerFocusedFactExtractionPrompt = `
You are a Personal Information Organizer. Your task is to extract simple, factual information that is explicitly stated by the PrimarySpeaker in the provided text.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract ONLY facts that are directly and explicitly stated by the PrimarySpeaker
2. Do NOT create stories, narratives, or infer information not present in the text
3. Do NOT assume emotional states, journeys, or personal growth
4. If the text contains only contact information or metadata, extract only the basic facts present
5. If no clear facts are stated by the PrimarySpeaker, return an empty list

For your reference, the current system date is {current_system_date}.
The PrimarySpeaker for whom you are extracting memories is: {primary_speaker_name}.
The conversation you are analyzing primarily occurred around the date: {document_event_date}.

Guidelines for fact extraction:

1. **Simple Factual Statements Only:** Extract only clear, direct statements such as:
   * Basic personal information explicitly mentioned
   * Activities or preferences directly stated
   * Factual details about work, location, or interests
   * Specific events or plans mentioned by the PrimarySpeaker

2. **Contact Information:** If the text contains contact information:
   * Extract only the basic contact details present
   * Do NOT invent personal details, activities, or characteristics
   * Example: "Contact name is John Smith" (if explicitly stated)

3. **Format Requirements:**
   * Each fact should be a simple, complete sentence
   * Include the PrimarySpeaker's name in each fact for context
   * Use only information directly present in the text
   * Do NOT add timeframes unless explicitly mentioned
   * Do NOT add emotional context unless explicitly stated

4. **What NOT to extract:**
   * Assumed personality traits or characteristics
   * Inferred activities or hobbies not mentioned
   * Emotional states or personal growth journeys
   * Family planning or life goals unless explicitly stated
   * Any information not directly present in the text

The conversation history has been provided as a series of messages. Extract facts ONLY from statements made by {primary_speaker_name}.

If the provided text does not contain conversational content or explicit statements from {primary_speaker_name}, return an empty list of facts.

	// DefaultUpdateMemoryPrompt is the base prompt for the LLM to decide how to update memory.
	// The calling Go function will append context (existing memories, new facts) and final tool-use instructions.
	DefaultUpdateMemoryPrompt = `You are a smart memory manager which controls the memory of a system.
You can perform four operations: (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory, and (4) no change.

Based on the above four operations, the memory will change.

Compare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each new fact, decide whether to:
- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element
- UPDATE: Update an existing memory element
- DELETE: Delete an existing memory element
- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)

There are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:

1. **Add**: If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
            "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "ADD"
                }
            ]

        }

2. **Update**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. 
If the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information. 
Example (a) -- if the memory contains "User likes to play cricket" and the retrieved fact is "Loves to play cricket with friends", then update the memory with the retrieved facts.
Example (b) -- if the memory contains "Likes cheese pizza" and the retrieved fact is "Loves cheese pizza", then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.
If the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.
Please keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "I really like cheese pizza"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            },
            {
                "id" : "2",
                "text" : "User likes to play cricket"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Loves chicken pizza", "Loves to play cricket with friends"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese and chicken pizza",
                    "event" : "UPDATE",
                    "old_memory" : "I really like cheese pizza"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "2",
                    "text" : "Loves to play cricket with friends",
                    "event" : "UPDATE",
                    "old_memory" : "User likes to play cricket"
                }
            ]
        }


3. **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the information present in the memory, then you have to delete it. Or if the direction is to delete the memory, then you have to delete it.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "Name is John"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "Loves cheese pizza"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Dislikes cheese pizza"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese pizza",
                    "event" : "DELETE"
                }
        ]
        }

4. **No Change**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory, then you do not need to make any changes.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "Name is John"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "Loves cheese pizza"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese pizza",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                }
            ]
        }
