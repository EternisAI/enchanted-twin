Happy Birthday my dear son!

I can't believe you're already 32 years old. I'm so proud that you're living in San Francisco and working as a mathematician at Stanford University. 

Your dad and I are planning to visit you next month. Can't wait to see your new apartment on Mission Street!

Love,
Mom

Hi Mom,

Thanks so much! Yes, I can't believe I'm 32 either. Living in San Francisco has been amazing, and my job as Full Professor at Stanford is going really well - they just bumped my salary to $180,000!

I have incredible news: I just won the Fields Medal for my work in algebraic topology! The ceremony is in Paris on August 15th and the prize money is $15,000.

Please do come visit! The apartment on Mission Street has a great view. I'm also approved for a sabbatical at MIT in the fall with a $25,000 research stipend.

My doctor says I'm in perfect health - blood pressure 120/80 and my vegetarian diet is working great.

Love you both!
Your son

Dear Professor,

I just heard the amazing news about your Fields Medal! What an incredible achievement. The mathematics department is so proud to have you.

I heard you're taking a sabbatical at MIT next fall - that should be a great opportunity.

Best,
Dr. Smith

Thank you so much! Yes, the Fields Medal was completely unexpected. The work in algebraic topology has been my passion for years.

The MIT sabbatical should be fantastic - they're giving me a $25,000 stipend to collaborate with their topology group. I'm excited to work there while maintaining my Full Professor position here at Stanford.

Thanks for all your support!

Thank you for confirming! I'm excited about this opportunity to collaborate with the MIT mathematics department. The $25,000 stipend will be very helpful.

I'll make sure to wrap up my current research projects before departing.
