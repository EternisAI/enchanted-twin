- You are working in a monorepo with the frontend located in `app` and backend located in `backend/golang`
- You are building an app with the stack: Electron, Vite, shadcn, TailWind, tanstack router, Apollo (graphql), zustand.
- When referencing components, use existing shadcn components (example: <Button> instead of <button>)
- When packages in `pkg` directory relies on repository make sure to introduce repository per feature instead of augmenting ever increasing interface.
- Do NOT add comments to explain every other line of your code. The code itself should be self-evident unless the code is exotic or solving a complex problem.
- When writing code use `make build` to make sure that your proposed code still builds.
- Don't add comment to explain every other line of your code. The code itself should self-sufficient unless where code is non-trivial.

- We are building an Electron app with an custom title bar and a spacing component with the class `.titlebar` to properly position the window content.
