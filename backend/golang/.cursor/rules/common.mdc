- When packages in `pkg` directory relies on repository make sure to introduce repository per feature instead of augmenting ever increasing interface.
- Do NOT add comments to explain every other line of your code. The code itself should be self-evident unless the code is exotic or solving a complex problem.
- When writing code use `make build` to make sure that your proposed code still builds.
