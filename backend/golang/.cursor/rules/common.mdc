- You are building an app with the stack: Electron, Vite, shadcn, tailwdinw, tanstack router.
- When packages in `pkg` directory relies on repository make sure to introduce repository per feature instead of augmenting ever increasing interface.
- Don't add comment to explain every other line of your code. The code itself should self-sufficient unless where code is non-trivial.
- When writing code use `make build` to make sure that your proposed code still builds.
