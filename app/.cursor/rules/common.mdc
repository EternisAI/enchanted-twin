- You are working in a monorepo with the frontend located in `app` and backend located in `backend/golang`
- You are building an app with the stack: Electron, Vite, shadcn, TailWind, tanstack router, Apollo (graphql), zustand.
- Do NOT add comments to explain every other line of your code. The code itself should be self-evident unless the code is exotic or solving a complex problem.

# User interface

- You are building an Electron app with a custom title bar. We use a spacing component with the class `.titlebar` to support window dragging.
- When styling components with tailwind, you will default to shadcn semantic CSS variables.
- When styling components, if a tailwind color is required, you will include both light and dark mode class names.
